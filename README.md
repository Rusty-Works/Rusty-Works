hey there! ðŸ‘‹

welcome to rusty sky - my little corner of the web where i showcase all the cool stuff i'm building with rust. you know how rust is mostly backend stuff that's hard to show off? well, this is my solution to that problem!

## what's this all about?

i'm learning rust and building some pretty interesting projects along the way. but since rust runs on the server side, it's not as easy to demonstrate as, say, a fancy website. so i created this space to show what i'm working on in a way that everyone can understand and interact with.

## what can you find here?

- all my rust projects with live demos
- detailed documentation of my learning journey
- guides and tutorials i've written while learning
- real-time visualizations of rust applications
- interactive examples of rust concepts

## current projects

here are some things i'm working on:
- high-performance api gateway
- blockchain data explorer
- real-time data processing engine
- and more coming soon!

## wanna learn together?

you can find all my documentation at `/docs`. i'm writing everything in a way that's easy to understand, even if you're just starting with rust. it's the kind of documentation i wish i had when i started!

## tech stack

this showcase is built with:
- next.js 15.5
- react 19
- tailwind css
- framer motion
- and of course, rust ðŸ¦€

## let's connect!

if you're also learning rust or interested in what i'm building, feel free to:
- check out my projects
- read through my docs
- suggest improvements
- share your own rust journey

## running locally

if you want to run this showcase on your machine:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see it in action!

## see it live
